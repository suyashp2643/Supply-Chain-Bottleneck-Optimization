## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides actionable insights through:

- **Key KPIs**: Avg. Production Days, Defect Rate, Top Bottleneck Category  
- **Trend Line Chart**: Delivery Deviation vs. Lead Time  
- **Stage-Level Analysis**: Avg. Days by Procurement, Production, Assembly, QC  
- **Root Cause by Product**: Bottlenecks by Category and Product Line  
- **Choropleth Map**: Delay Probability by U.S. state  

## Key Insights

- **Port Delay** is the top cause of disruption (26K+ cases)
- **Product A** faces the most issues, especially in Production
- **Defect Rate** is alarmingly high at 76.5%
- **QC and Production** are the slowest stages
- **Texas and Illinois** experience the highest shipment delays

## Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For visual analytics and dashboard creation  
- **Python (Pandas)**: For initial data cleaning and transformation  
- **GitHub**: Version control and Project hosting
